### About

This is a basic application that I created to test my ability to design a small full-stack application with modern architecture.

It is not without issues, and there are some small fixes that I may implement going forward with this project.

This project is unhosted. It is a nonstatic website, so it can't be hosted on github pages. Feel free to host, though!

If you decide to fork and improve this, note that you will need a .env file in the path /outlook-replica-backend/ . Also, make sure to run "npm install" in both /outlook-replica-backend/ and /outlook-replica-frontend/ . Also, credit me if possible.

Thanks!
